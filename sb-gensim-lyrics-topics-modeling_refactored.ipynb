Originally launched as Rap Genius with a focus on hip-hop music, it was initially a crowdsourced website where people could fill in the lyrics of rap music and give an interpretation of the lyrics. Over the years the site has grown to contain several million annotated texts from all eras ( from [Wikipedia Genius page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(company))).\n","\n","\n","## Load the data in memory\n","\n","Data are all contain in a big 9GB csv file (around 5 millions rows). It could be difficult to load all this data in our computer memory. To deal with this issue, I made a loading class to split the data in 6 pickles files to improve the compressness of the data which aim to improve the loading speed in the memory. Then the pickles are randomly draw to improve generality of the data. We currently assumed the data pickles batch are identically distributed (we will explore the data batches at the second part).
